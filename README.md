# PSITNOTES
--> This is our first mini project based on web development, we are building a website named as (PSITNOTES.com) which will help 2nd year B.Tech students to find class notes of each subjects for free. 
--> Our project provides versitality in notes as any number of teachers teaching the same subject can upload their notes and hence it depends mainly on the student which notes to opt for.
--> To free our website from unauthorised use, we require teachers to sign in using their ids.
